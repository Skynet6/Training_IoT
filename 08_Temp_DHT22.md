### 08. DHT22 - Temperature/Humidity Sensor (`08_Temp_DHT22`)

In this exercise we will:
* Connect an actual temperature and humidity sensors.
* Push sensor readings to the web app.
* It is time to do some refactor to the previous device code.  

The web app version from `06_RemoteControl_JSON_App` will be used.
The device code is in `07_RemoteControl_Temp_Device`.

### After the refactoring

Up until now most of the code was more procedural C than object oriented C++. Also our solution now is capable of handling many endpoint types.
